Elementary transform sequence (ETS) models
==========================================

.. codeauthor:: Jesse Haviland

Elementary transforms are canonic rotations or translations about, or along,
the x-, y- or z-axes.  The amount of rotation or translation can be a constant
or a variable.  A variable amount corresponds to a joint.

Consider the example:

.. runblock:: pycon
   :linenos:

   >>> from roboticstoolbox import ET
   >>> ET.Rx(45, 'deg')
   >>> ET.tz(0.75)
   >>> e = ET.Rx(0.3) * ET.tz(0.75)
   >>> print(e)
   >>> e.fkine([])

In lines 2-5 we defined two elementary transforms.  Line 2 defines a rotation
of 45Â° about the x-axis, and line 4 defines a translation of 0.75m along the z-axis.
Compounding them in line 6, the result is the two elementary transforms in a
sequence - an elementary transform sequence (ETS).  An ETS can be arbitrarily
long.

Line 8 *evaluates* the forward kinematics of the sequence, substituting in values,
and the result is an SE(3) matrix encapsulated in an ``4x4`` numpy array.

The real power comes from having variable arguments to the elementary transforms
as shown in this example where we define a simple two link planar manipulator.


.. runblock:: pycon
   :linenos:

   >>> from roboticstoolbox import ET
   >>> e = ET.Rz() * ET.tx(1) * ET.Rz() * ET.tx(1)
   >>> print(e)
   >>> len(e)
   >>> e[1:3]
   >>> e.fkine([0, 0])
   >>> e.fkine([1.57, -1.57])

Line 2 succinctly describes the kinematics in terms of elementary transforms: a
rotation around the z-axis by the first joint angle, then a translation in the
x-direction, then a rotation around the z-axis by the second joint angle, and
finally a translation in the x-direction.

Line 3 creates the elementary transform sequence, with variable transforms.
``e`` is a single object that encapsulates a list of elementary transforms, and list like 
methods such as ``len`` as well as indexing and slicing as shown in lines 5-8.

Lines 9-18 *evaluate* the sequence, and substitutes elements from the passed
arrays as the joint variables.

This approach is general enough to be able to describe any serial-link robot
manipulator.  For a branched manipulator we can use ETS to describe the
connections between every parent and child link pair.

The ETS inherits list-like properties and has methods like ``reverse`` and ``pop``.
